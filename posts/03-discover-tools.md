Title: Building a Coding Agent : Part 3 - Automatic discovery of tools

Tags: Clojure, OpenAI, LLM
Description: Use metadata to discover agent tools and build the tool definitions and invocation registry automatically.

In the [previous](02-give-it-a-tool.html) post, we looked at how to provide a tool to the LLM for getting the weather.
To simplify the post we had used hard-coding and provided it directly to the LLM. In this post let's look at how we can use the Clojure metadata properties to discover tools.

# How to use Clojure metadata to discover a tool
Clojure allows tagging of all symbols with a metadata map. This allows arbitrary annotation of the code and data.
We can query the metadata attached to any symbol by:
```clojure
(pprint (meta #'+))
;; {:added "1.2",
;;  :ns #object[clojure.lang.Namespace 0x109f5dd8 "clojure.core"],
;;  :name +,
;;  :file "clojure/core.clj",
;;  :inline-arities
;;  #object[clojure.core$_GT_1_QMARK_ 0x47dd778 "clojure.core$_GT_1_QMARK_@47dd778"],
;;  :column 1,
;;  :line 986,
;;  :arglists ([] [x] [x y] [x y & more]),
;;  :doc
;;  "Returns the sum of nums. (+) returns 0. Does not auto-promote\n  longs, will throw on overflow. See also: +'",
;;  :inline
;;  #object[clojure.core$nary_inline$fn__5625 0x7de4a01f "clojure.core$nary_inline$fn__5625@7de4a01f"]}
```
Note the standard :doc, :name attributes which Clojure uses. We can add our custom metadata to all the tools we will provide the LLM. Keeping the metadata with the function makes it easier to keep the documentation and implementation in sync.
For the `get-current-weather` function we will add the following metadata:
```clojure
(defn
  ^{:tool {:name "get_current_weather"
           :description "Retrieves the current weather information for a specified location"
           :parameters {:type "object"
                        :properties {:location {:type "string"
                                                :description "The city and state/country for which to get weather information"}
                                     :unit {:type "string"
                                            :enum ["celsius" "fahrenheit" "kelvin"]
                                            :description "Temperature unit for the response"
                                            :default "celsius"}}
                        :required ["location"]}}}
  get-current-weather
  [location]
  "-25.0 C")
```
To keep things simple, we will still keep the entire metadata needed by the API as a single object which we can pass as is. We will pass in the tools to the `call-llm-api` function for it to be included in the API call.
We also need a function which will do dynamic discovery of the tools written. That can be written as below:
```clojure
(defn- get-tool-list
  "Discovers all functions in provided namespace ns with :tool metadata"
  [ns]
  (->> (ns-publics ns)
       vals
       (filter #(:tool (meta %)))
       (mapv #(hash-map :type "function" :function (:tool (meta %))))))
```
This function inspects all public symbols in the passed in namespace and filters the list to all the symbols with the `:tool` metadata attached. Using these metadata it creates the list to passed to the LLM completion call.
We also need a registry to invoke the tool when we find a matching tool call from the LLM. That can be achieved by creating a mapping of the tool name to the function symbol as below:
```clojure
(defn build-tool-registry
  "Builds a map of tool names to their corresponding functions"
  [ns]
  (->> (ns-publics ns)
       vals
       (filter #(:tool (meta %)))
       (reduce (fn [acc f]
                 (assoc acc (get-in (meta f) [:tool :name]) f))
               {})))
```
# Wiring up the tool execution
Now, that we have both of these we can change the `handle-tool-call` to utilize both of these.
```clojure
(defn handle-tool-call
  [response tools]
  (let [tool-calls (:tool_calls response)]
    (mapv (fn [tc]
            {:tool_call_id (:id tc)
             :content (invoke-tool tools tc)
             :role "tool"}) tool-calls)))
```
We will also introduce an `invoke-tool` function to better handle parameters to the call.
```clojure
(defn- invoke-tool [tools tc]
  (let [name (get-in tc [:function :name])
        fn (get tools name)]
    (println "\u001b[92mtool\u001b[0m:" name)
    (if (some? fn)
      (fn (parse-json-arguments (get-in tc [:function :arguments])))
      (str "Error calling " name))))
```
The complete code looks like:
```clojure
(ns agent.core
  (:require
   [cheshire.core :as json]
   [clojure.edn :as edn]
   [clojure.java.io :as io]

    (when-not (or (str/blank? message) (= message "quit"))
      {:role "user" :content message})))

(defn- display-assistant-response!

(defn- extract-first-response
  "The LLM call can return multiple responses. Extract the first one and print a warning if there are more than one responses"
  [response]
  (let [choices (:choices response)

       (reduce (fn [acc f]
                 (assoc acc (get-in (meta f) [:tool :name]) f))

        tool-messages (handle-tool-call assistant-response tools-registry)
        new-messages (add-message-to-history messages assistant-response)]
    (if (seq tool-messages)
      (let [tool-message-history (reduce add-message-to-history new-messages tool-messages)]

      new-messages)))

(defn -main
  []
  (let [config (read-config!)
        tools (get-tool-list 'agent.tools)
        tools-registry (build-tool-registry 'agent.tools)]
    (loop [user-message (read-user-input!)
           messages []]
      (when (some? user-message)
        (let [new-messages (add-message-to-history messages user-message)
              messages-including-response (get-assistant-response new-messages config tools tools-registry)
              assistant-message (:content (last messages-including-response))]
          (display-assistant-response! assistant-message)
          (recur (read-user-input!) messages-including-response))))))
```
We have moved the tools to a separate namespace `agent.tools` to manage the code better.

The agent works as before. Notice that the multiple calls to the tool as the LLM can't believe the value of the temperature it is getting :D.

That's it for this post. Let's look at how easy it is to build a code-editing agent in the next post.
