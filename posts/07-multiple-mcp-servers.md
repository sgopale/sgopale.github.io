Title:  Building a Coding Agent : Part 7 - Multiple MCP Servers
Date: 2025-11-11
Tags: Clojure, OpenAI, LLM
Description: Configure the coding agent to connect to multiple MCP servers and combine their tool registries.

In the previous post we looked at connecting to a MCP server - specifically to the Anthropic file system MCP server. Let's extend the functionality of the coding agent to talk to multiple configurable MCP servers.
# mcp.json configuration
We will reuse the same format that Claude Code uses for configuring MCP servers. The file is of the format
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "/Users/username/Desktop",
        "/path/to/other/allowed/dir"
      ]
    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Each MCP server is specified with a path to an executable. We will only deal with local MCP servers, leaving remote MCP servers for another post.

# Dealing with multiple MCP servers
We had directly invoked the tool call on the MCP client connection as we had a single MCP server and did not need to disambiguate between calls. While supporting multiple MCP servers we need to route the tool call to the correct MCP server. For doing this lets remove the direct MCP tool call and utilize the tool registry to direct the calls. Recall that we had built a tool registry to register function based tool calls. The registry was a map of the form `name -> function`. Let us keep the same structure, except we will bind the function to a dynamic function which calls the MCP tool as appropriate.

We will bind each MCP tool to a function of the form. The server and name are already available when creating the binding. The args are passed in by the `invoke-tool` call.
```clojure
(fn [args] (call-tool server name args))

(defn- build-tool-registry
  [client]
  (let [result (.listTools client)
        tools (.tools result)
        tool-metadata (mapv #(mcp-tool->openai-tool (tool-result->clj %)) tools)]
    (reduce (fn [acc f]
              (let [name (get-in f [:function :name])]
                (assoc acc name (fn [args] (call-tool client name args)))))
            {} tool-metadata)))
```
Since, our regular tool requires parsed json arguments - we will change that function binding to convert the json string args into a Clojure map.
```clojure
(defn build-tool-registry
  "Builds a map of tool names to their corresponding functions"
  [ns]
  (->> (ns-publics ns)
       vals
       (filter #(:tool (meta %)))
       (reduce (fn [acc f]
                 (let [name (get-in (meta f) [:tool :name])]
                   (assoc acc name (fn [args] (f (parse-json-arguments args))))))
               {})))
```
# Demo
We will force the LLM to use the thinking tools with the following prompt - "Help me write a factorial function in CLJS. Please think a bit before writing the code. Please use the tools available to you."
With this prompt the LLM uses both the MCP servers available to it.

LLM : Thanks — I thought through options before writing code and used the workspace to create a small CLJS module with two implementations and examples.

What I considered
- Provide a safe, tail-recursive implementation for ordinary JS Numbers (fast, but limited by IEEE-754 and 2^53 precision).
- Provide a BigInt-based implementation for arbitrarily large factorials using JS BigInt via interop (requires modern JS engine or a polyfill).
- Validate input (non-negative integer).
- Use loop/recur so recursion is tail-recursive and safe for reasonably large n.

What I wrote
I created src/factorial/core.cljs with:
- factorial: tail-recursive using loop/recur; returns a JS Number (double).
- factorial-bigint: tail-recursive using js/BigInt; returns a BigInt.
- run-examples and -main for quick testing.

File: src/factorial/core.cljs
(You can open this file in your project — I created it for you.)

Key functions (contents in the file):

ns factorial.core

1) factorial
- Signature: (factorial n)
- Behavior: checks that n is an integer and non-negative, then computes n! with loop/recur, returning a JS Number.
- Notes: Overflow / loss of integer precision beyond about 2^53-1 / ~170! for magnitude.

2) factorial-bigint
- Signature: (factorial-bigint n)
- Behavior: converts n to a JS BigInt (js/BigInt), checks non-negative, computes n! with loop/recur and BigInt arithmetic, returns a BigInt.
- Notes: Accepts numbers or string representations convertible to BigInt; requires environment support for BigInt (modern Node, browsers).

3) run-examples / -main
- Small helper that prints sample results:
  - factorial 5 => 120
  - factorial-bigint 20 => 2432902008176640000n (printed via str)

Usage examples (REPL)
- (require 'factorial.core)
- (factorial 5)           => 120
- (factorial-bigint 20)   => 2432902008176640000n
- (str (factorial-bigint 100)) => (string of 100!)

Notes, caveats, and tips
- Use factorial for small n where performance/primitive numbers are fine.
- Use factorial-bigint for large n and when exact integer results are required.
- BigInt interop: js/BigInt is used. On older runtimes without BigInt, you'll get an error; a BigInt polyfill or alternate big-integer library would be required.
- If you want a pure CLJS arbitrary-precision library (works everywhere), I can rewrite factorial-bigint to use a JS big-integer library (like big-integer.js via npm) or a ClojureScript big-integer library.

If you’d like, I can:
- Add tests (cljs.test).
- Provide project config / build sample (shadow-cljs or cljs.main) to run on Node or in browser.
- Add a memoized or lazy-stream implementation for many repeated factorial calls.

Would you like me to open the file contents here, add tests, or show how to compile/run it with shadow-cljs / cljs.main?
